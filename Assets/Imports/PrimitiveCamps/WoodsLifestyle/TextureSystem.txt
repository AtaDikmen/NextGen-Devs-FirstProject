Woods Lifestyle uses a brand new texture system, specially designed for low poly models. It makes texturing easy and allows you to use a single texture across all
models. The texture is designed in such a way to cover most of the colours in the spectrum, thus there is no need to struggle on with multiple textures for
different models or tons of materials to deal with.

The texture works as follow: At the top there is your bright colours; The middel normal colours; At the bottom dull colours.
