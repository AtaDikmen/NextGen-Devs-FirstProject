Notes: The new version (v1.1) uses a specially designed texture. You can replace most of the single colour models (LogHeap_01_b.fbx for example) 
with a standard Unity material. Replace susch models with your own materials or use supplied materials
located under the main Materials folder.

All vegetation except the trees uses their own materials which can be found under each appropriate vegetation-type folder.

All models are located under the Models folder, some premade 
buildings can be found under Prefabs.
